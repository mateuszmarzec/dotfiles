# dotfiles
My "dotfiles" configuration for MacOS. Contains Tmux, NeoVim, Fish, ITerm, Packer and OMF configurations and plugins I'm currently using ðŸš€


## Usage
1. Clone repository
2. Just copy files to you root directory
`cp -r . ~/`
3. Make sure you have installed all required packages (Tmux, NeoVim, Fish, iTerm2, OMF)
4. Restart **Tmux** configuration files
5. Open **Neovim** and install plugins
6. Enjoy using modern beautiful terminal and Neovim based IDE
your 

PS. Making everything working correctly maybe more complicated. It depends on which packages you have already installed. This dotfiles aren't plug-and-play. Make note the best way is to configurate your own settings and just replace them using this one. Furthermore this configuration is prepared for **Python** and **TypeScript** web development. If you want to use it with other programming languages probably you will have to install extra **NeoVim** plugins.
